2. **Link to Vercel and GitHub**: Run the following command to link your local instance with your Vercel and GitHub accounts. This will create a `.vercel` directory.

   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

3. **Pull Environment Variables**: Download your environment variables using Vercel CLI.

   ```bash
   vercel env pull
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Use pnpm to install all project dependencies.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Run the Project**: Finally, run the development server.
