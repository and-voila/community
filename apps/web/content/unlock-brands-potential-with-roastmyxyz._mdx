Tired of the same old sugar-coated marketing advice? Prepare for some straight talk with the launch of RoastMy.xyz.

We're thrilled to unveil a service that's unlike anything you've encountered before. Imagine a space where your marketing strategy isn't just analyzed—it's improved with insights that matter, pinpointing the problems bogging your brand down.

We promise "marketing roasts" that'll reveal flaws and spur meaningful improvements—without all the jargon and rah-rah language common in the industry.

As co-founder Ambreen Dar puts it, "We're not here to gas you up or give you a pep talk. We give clear-eyed, critical feedback so you can actually strengthen your marketing strategy."

> "Working with RoastMy.xyz was a game-changer for my brand. Their sharp, direct feedback helped me hone my messaging and tripled my conversion rate!" - Debra Trappen, President, D11 Consulting

## Our origin story

We created RoastMy.xyz out of frustration with the quality of advice in the field. "We kept seeing the same generic listicles about '10 Ways to Grow Your Audience' or '7 Must-Have Features for Websites,'" said Sam Rizvi, consulting technologist. "It was all fluff with no real substance."

After decades of being inundated with superficial tips, we knew there had to be a better way.

Ambreen explains our motivation clearly, "We wanted to cut through the noise and offer critiques with real depth and insight. Strategies that don't just scratch the surface but actually dig into the root of the problem."

This sparked our idea for a service that would provide meaningful critiques instead of one-size-fits-all recommendations. After testing various methods over 10 months, RoastMy.xyz was born.

## Who it's for

"We're here for the go-getters and the innovators, the folks who aren't afraid to shake things up with their brand," shares Sam Rizvi, consulting technologist. "Whether you're unveiling something fresh or giving your brand a bit of a facelift, our platform is like that straight-shooting buddy who tells it like it is, helping you step up your game."

In a marketplace flooded with polished pitches and glossy façades, it's easy to lose sight of what really propels a brand forward—raw, unfiltered insights that ignite genuine growth. It's time to cast aside the stale, rehearsed advice that clutters the industry.

At RoastMy.xyz, we see ourselves as a beacon of truth, offering a service tailored to carve out the authentic core of your brand strategy. Let's get real, let's get candid, and let's foster a marketing approach that truly resonates.

Here's who can benefit most:

- Companies launching new products or initiatives
- Brands undertaking a redesign or overhaul
- Marketers looking for unbiased feedback on their strategy

We cater to brands eager for honest, no-nonsense feedback—ready to embark on a journey of genuine improvement. If you're prepared for candid insights that can steer your brand's growth trajectory upward, you've come to the right place. We don't just turn up the roast, we ignite a flame that can drive your brand to new heights, offering critiques that are actionable and catalysts for real change.

Ambreen further elaborates, "Our clients are innovative disruptors who aren't just seeking a pat on the back. They're looking for insights that can truly carve out a distinctive space in a crowded market. They value truth over platitudes, seeking advice that's not only honest but also constructive."

## Our process

Clients choose a "roast" matching their needs—website, branding, social media. They then submit materials like logos, ads, landing pages, and posts.

At RoastMy, we use the "ROAST" framework to identify flaws:

- Reach—Is messaging resonating with the target audience?
- Objectives—Do strategies align with business goals?
- Authenticity—Does branding reflect the company's identity?
- Storytelling—Does the narrative compel and engage?
- Transformation—Is the brand evolving appropriately?

We dig deep to understand each brand before roasting. This context helps us provide feedback that's tailored and actionable. Clients receive a detailed report outlining roast insights, including strategic guidance for improvement.

We're not just critics, we're your growth partners. We don't merely identify the gaps—we fill them with strategic insights to steer your brand toward success.

"A roast without strategy is just criticism," said Ambreen Dar. "We offer an executable roadmap to turn flaws into strengths."

Here's some examples of strategic recommendations after a roast:

- Revamping brand messaging to better resonate with the target demographic
- Overhauling website navigation and CTAs to boost conversions
- Refining social media captions to balance brand voice and engagement
- Optimizing page speed and SEO to drive organic traffic
- Redesigning email sequences for better open and clickthrough rates

"Our goal is growth," said Sam Rizvi. "We don't just spotlight flaws—we offer a plan to evolve into something better and stronger."

## The RoastMy magic

"RoastMy.xyz revamped our website from a drab, user-unfriendly mess into a dynamic, engaging platform. Their insights were nothing short of a roadmap to success. We saw a 70% increase in user engagement within a month!" - CEO of GreenSolutions

What sets us apart is how we blend candid feedback with growth strategy. Our roasts don't just identify weaknesses, they provide a concrete plan to turn them into strengths.

One client came to us after a new product launch fizzled. Their messaging roast revealed vague positioning with no unique value proposition. We helped craft a compelling narrative grounded in the product's competitive advantage. Results? A 5x increase in conversions within 3 months.

Another client had a high-traffic website but dismal time-on-page. A UX roast uncovered confusing navigation and a corporate vibe. We guided a redesign featuring a more intuitive IA and engaging brand voice. In 6 weeks, time-on-page doubled.

"The team at RoastMy.xyz doesn't hold back, and that's exactly what our marketing strategy needed. They identified the blind spots in our branding strategy, providing actionable solutions that led to a 50% increase in our customer base within three months!" - Marketing Director at FastTrack Startups

For brands seeking candid, expertise-backed advice, RoastMy.xyz promises a dose of honesty in a field prone to fluff.

Our framework combines precise critique with strategic solutions all delivered through an authentic brand voice—not jargon and platitudes.

Simply put, we don't just spotlight flaws. We offer a roadmap to make your marketing strategy shine.
