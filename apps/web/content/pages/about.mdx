## The sizzle behind the roast

Ah, opinions. Everyone has them, but let's be honest, not all opinions are created equal. You see, people have been practically hurling money at us for our unfiltered insights for so long that we had a lightbulb moment:

> Why not package this brilliance and let the masses bask in our glow?

But hold your fire emojis, this ain't your grandma's roast. We're talking about a scathing yet sophisticated teardown that'll leave your marketing assets smoldering and your competitors wondering where they went wrong.

Think of us as the sommeliers of sass, the connoisseurs of critique. We pair our roasts with a fine vintage of actionable advice that you won't find in your average Reddit thread.

So, whether you're on the brink of launching your next big thing or are stuck in the eternal limbo of "Why is nobody clicking my carefully chosen CTA?", we're here to spice up your life.

### How we cook up your success

So, you're intrigued by our audacity to charge for what many give away for free on Twitter. Cute. We've honed our skills to focus on things we're practically overqualified for—mostly the stuff you desperately need.

#### Step 1: Order your roast

Browse our roast catalog, pick your poison, and hit that checkout button. It's like online shopping, but for your ego.

#### Step 2: The crucial survey

After you’ve parted ways with your money, you'll receive a survey so meticulously crafted it could make a tax auditor blush. Take your sweet time; your input is the secret sauce in our roast recipe.

#### Step 3: Your roast, now cooking

Once we've dissected your survey (and maybe shared a chuckle at your expense), your roast order is officially in our kitchen. Expect an email when we fire up the burners, usually within two business days.

#### Step 4: Where the magic happens

We take your raw, unseasoned marketing and turn it into a digital feast. Each roast comes with its own set of deliverables that are as self-explanatory as a stop sign. For the gourmet roasts, we'll also set up a presentation call. Fancy, right?

#### Step 5: DIY or die trying

Armed with your freshly roasted insights, you'll embark on the perilous journey of implementation. Get stuck? We have a Discord for that. We’re like your Fairy Godmothers of marketing, just a tad more sarcastic.

#### Step 6: Need a little extra sizzle?

If you're too bougie to get your hands dirty or just need that extra push, we offer an unlimited design/build subscription. But let’s be clear, our roasts are designed to be self-service feasts.

### The icing on the roast: 100% Delight Guaranteed

If you're not head-over-heels with your roast, we'll fix it. Still not satisfied? We'll refund you. Your delight is our endgame, even if we have to roast ourselves in the process.

So there you have it—the alchemy behind turning your 'meh' into 'OMG.' Ready to get roasted?

## Meet the master chefs at BRIL.LA

Gather 'round, curious wanderers, for the origin story you didn’t know you needed. We are the masterminds behind BRIL.LA, LLC., a band of digital marketers so seasoned, we're practically marinated. United since 2014, we've been breaking the mold and occasionally some egos.

### The contrarians behind the curtain

We zig when others zag, and we've been zagging hard since before it was cool. You might say we're the rebels of the marketing world, if rebels had Google Analytics certifications.

### Slow to Flow: It's not what you think

After the whirlwind that was 2020, we birthed the 'Slow to Flow' movement. No, it’s not a bladder issue. It's our life mantra. We slow down to nurture what matters—family, health, the occasional Netflix binge—so that when we work, we're a torrential force of brilliance.

### A journey of many roads

We've pivoted more than a professional ballerina. Newsletters, AI, acquisitions by unnamed software magnates—we've seen it all. But it took a global pandemic and a lot of soul-searching to realize what we're truly good at: digital marketing, bossing people around, and serving up roasts so fiery, they could power a SpaceX rocket.

So, we took this unholy trinity of skills and launched our next adventure. It's where our collective genius meets your marketing mayhem. And let’s be honest, the world has been waiting for this.

If you're tired of the same old marketing spiel and craving something with a bit more kick, you're in the right kitchen.

### Our league of extraordinary roasters

Meet the culinary masterminds, the jesters of genius, the people your marketing didn’t know it needed but won’t be able to live without.

#### Ambreen Dar: The Creative Alchemist

Creative Lead & Co-Founder
Ambreen is our resident creative wizard. After years of teaching design, she realized she’d rather be creating than preaching. Trading chalk for pixels, she dived head-first into digital marketing. Armed with her wits and four fur-balls who swear she’s the cat's meow, she's the artistic engine behind BRIL.LA.

#### Rebekah Radice: The Oracle of Branding

CEO & Co-Founder
Rebekah is a reformed narcissist turned digital prophet. With two decades in the global brand game, she now uses her powers for good. When not steering the BRIL.LA ship, she's bamboozling her family into believing she's a Michelin-star Italian chef. Spoiler alert: the jig is up, but we're still eating it up.

#### Sam Rizvi: The Techie Whisperer

Consulting Technologist
Sam is what you get when you cross a software architect with a stand-up comedian. After retiring (read: failing at golf), he got roped back into the grind by Ambreen and Rebekah. Now he's the one making our digital world blink, pop, and occasionally explode—in a good way. Sam brings a blend of academic rigor, real-world triumphs, and total catastrophes to our tech game. It's not about the degrees or the IPOs; it's about making things work, and work well. Also, the man loves tacos so basically, he thinks he's perfect.

### Ready to Turn Up the Heat?

Enough about us, let's talk about you. If you've made it this far, you're clearly interested in not just any roast, but a roast from us. So why keep us waiting?
