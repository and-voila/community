## Privacy & Security

### How secure is my information?

Let's just say if our security was a fortress, it'd be a big, scary one with crocodiles in the moat. Payments are handled by Shopify Pay and PayPal, both PCI-DSS Level I providers. So yeah, we're as secure as your grandma's secret cookie recipe.

### What information do you collect?

Just the essentials. We collect only what's needed to process your orders or what's mandated by those fun-loving folks who make the laws. We're all about privacy—our analytics are so anonymous, they could be in witness protection.

### Do you share my information?

Nope. We're not in the business of selling your secrets. We only share your info with the systems and providers we use, and that's just so they can do their jobs. It's all professional, we promise.

### What about tracking and analytics?

Ah, the fun stuff. While we do love data, we're not stalkers. If you get distracted by a funny TikTok midway through checkout, we might give you a gentle nudge, but only because you shared your email with us first.

### Is anything 100% secure?

Ah, the million-dollar question. The short answer is no. But rest assured, we're doing everything we can to protect your data. Remember those crocodiles? They're pretty hungry.

### What do you do with my roast after it's delivered?

Your roast is your business, not billboard material for us. If you're thrilled and want to share it as a testimonial, we'd be honored. Otherwise, it stays between us. And yes, we'll definitely ask for a review—acquisition costs are no joke, you know.
