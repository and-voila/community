We're all in on making our digital digs as accessible as an all-night diner. We're hustling to meet those swanky WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Why? 'Cause we want everyone to savor the And Voila experience, no holds barred.

## Holler If You Spot a Snag

Accessibility isn't a "set it and forget it" kind of deal. It's an evolving masterpiece, like a fine wine or a TikTok algorithm. So if you hit a snag, spill the tea. We're all ears for your pointers on how to up our game.

### No Decoder Ring Required

We're keeping it real with keyboard-friendly, screen reader-amiable, and color-contrast-approved content. You won't need a decoder ring to understand us; we're as straightforward as a GPS with a sense of humor.

### It's All in the Alt-Text

Pictures worth a thousand words? Cool, but what's a thousand words to a screen reader? That's why our images come with alt-text, your screen reader's BFF.

### Say It, Don't Just Play It

All our vids come captioned so you can get the gist even if you forgot your earbuds. Transcripts? Oh, we've got those too.

### Big Text, Big Impact

You like your text large and in charge? So do we. Zoom in all you want; our content won't play hide and seek behind a horizontal scrollbar.

### Work in Progress

Look, we're not claiming to be the accessibility messiahs here. We know we've got work to do, and we're on it. Think of accessibility as a marathon, not a sprint; we're in it for the long haul.

### Need It Your Way? Just Say

If our format isn't jiving with your accessibility needs, hit us up. We'll hustle to get you what you need in a format that's more your style.

### Your Two Cents Make Us Richer
