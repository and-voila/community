## Supported Versions

Our project is continually evolving, just like a fledgling spell in the hands of a master wizard. There are no older, less effective versions lurking in the shadows. Every new update, patch, and awe-inspiring feature is promptly applied to your current version of AndVoila.gg.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Here's the crucial part: your safety and security are paramount to us. Should you discover a security vulnerability, **[contact us directly](mailto:hi@bril.la)** rather than posting it on the public issue tracker.

Taking this approach allows us to remedy the situation without inciting undue concern.

We highly value your assistance in maintaining a secure community. You can expect an acknowledgment within 48 hours of sending your report, followed by a comprehensive response within a week, detailing our action plan for addressing the issue you've identified.

We pledge to keep you informed of our progress in resolving the vulnerability and making a public announcement. If you don't hear back from us within 48 hours, feel free to reach out again to ensure we received your initial message.

Your discretion until we've adequately addressed the vulnerability is much appreciated. Thank you for contributing to the security and well-being of the AndVoila.gg community.
